# titanic-eda-project
Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover survival trends using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

# 🚢 Titanic EDA Project

**Task 2 – Data Analytics Internship Project**  
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle using Python.

## 📊 Objectives
- Clean missing and inconsistent data
- Explore survival patterns by gender, class, age, and embarkation
- Visualize key insights using Python libraries

## 🔁 Workflow
1. Load and inspect dataset
2. Clean missing values (`Age`, `Embarked`, `Cabin`)
3. Convert and categorize data
4. Perform univariate and bivariate analysis
5. Visualize data using Seaborn and Matplotlib
6. Extract insights from trends

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## 📌 Key Insights
- 🚺 Women had higher survival rates than men
- 🎟️ 1st class passengers were more likely to survive
- 🛳️ Port 'C' had better survival outcomes

## 📁 Files
- `titanic_eda.py`: Full EDA script
- `titanic_cleaned.csv`: Cleaned dataset (optional)
- `screenshots/`: Saved plots and visualizations
